## How to set up module

[Click here for step by step instructions (outdated)](https://github.com/IamWarHead/ddb-game-log/wiki)

&nbsp;

## Known issues

**Getting disconnected and reconnected every 2 hours**
D&D Beyond closes websocket connection every 2 hours so its a proper working mechanics if the module is reconnecting automatically.

&nbsp;

## Known incompatibilities

:exclamation: Beyond20 unfortunately blocking the Game Log feature of DND Beyond, it is not passing the roll data to the socket server. In addition to this **you have to disable the Beyond20 Chrome Extension and the module too** or DDB Gamelog won't be able to display your rolls.

:exclamation: Users have noticed some problems when using the module in Forge instances. Issues are under investigation currently.

:exclamation: Forien's Copy Environment module can cause serious issues with the settings of the module. The issue is under investigation.
