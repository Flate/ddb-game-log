## Known incompatibilities

:exclamation: Beyond20 unfortunately blocking the Game Log feature of DND Beyond, it is not passing the roll data to the socket server. In addition to this **you have to disable the Beyond20 Chrome Extension and the module too** or DDB Gamelog won't be able to display your rolls.
